## üö¶ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Duardz/axionark.git
cd axionark
npm install
```

### 2. Firebase Setup

1. Create a project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password provider)
3. Create **Firestore Database** in production mode
4. Get your config from Project Settings > General

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Add your Firebase config:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain

```

### 4. Firestore Security Rules

Replace default rules with these:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /journal/{entryId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.uid;
    }
    
    match /exploits/{exploitId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.uid;
    }
    
    match /usernames/{username} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid;
    }
  }
}
```
